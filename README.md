# ðŸ”¬ Exon Skipping ASO Design Pipeline

This repository contains a Python pipeline to **design exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)** for therapeutic purposes. It supports **mutation-aware frame disruption simulation**, **NMD prediction**, and **protein domain impact analysis**, based on **Ensembl GTF/FASTA** and **UniProt annotations**.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This tool is built to streamline the discovery of ASOs that promote exon skipping in disease-relevant transcripts â€” with the goal of restoring open reading frame (ORF), reducing harmful protein expression, or bypassing pathogenic mutations.

It performs:

- CDS extraction from reference GTF and FASTA
- Simulation of exon skipping
- Detection of frameshift and NMD
- Domain analysis using UniProt XML
- Design of internal (ASO-E) and junction-spanning (ASO-J) ASOs
- Integration of mutation data (VCF or TSV)
- Multi-exon skipping to restore reading frame
- Generation of exportable summary tables
